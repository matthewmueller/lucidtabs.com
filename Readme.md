# LucidTabs

Open sourcing an old project of mine. Some people might find the templating library and some the MVC implementation useful.

The original idea was to reimagine how guitar tabs were made and learned. I wanted to extend this to other instruments like piano, saxophone, and drums. 

I stopped developing this site when I found out that guitar tab sites were illegal in the US.
